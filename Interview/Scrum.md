## Scrum

***

- What is Scrum?
    - One of the most popular agile methodologies in use today. 
    - Scrum is a lightweight software development methodology that focuses on having small time-boxed sprints of new functionality that are incorporated into an integrated product baseline. Scrum places an emphasis on transparent customer interaction, feedback and adjustments rather than documentation and prediction.
    -  Instead of phases, Scrum projects are broken down into releases and sprints. 
    -  At the end of each sprint you have a fully functioning system that could be released.

- Roles in Agile Scrum
    - There can many different roles in a Scrum project, but there are three core roles:
      - Product Owner
      - Scrum Master
      - Scrum Team
    - All of these people are committed to the scrum project, and are augmented by various other specialist roles such as testers, test automation engineers, cybersecurity experts, user experience designers, business analysts, functional experts, and performance/load engineers.


- Product Owner
    - The product owner role on a Scrum team is the person that is responsible for managing the backlog of work and overseeing releases and sprints. They act as the project manager for the Scrum team, although the agile community generally doesn’t use that term. The product owner is responsible for representing the voice of the customer (and other external stakeholders), ensuring that all development work reflects the needs of the end-user.

- Scrum Master
    - This role is responsible for helping the team to follow the Scrum process, and focuses almost exclusively on the process itself. They are not involved in the decision-making, but act as a lodestar to guide the team through the scrum process with their experience and expertise.

- Scrum Team
  - According to the Scrum Alliance, a typical Scrum team (called a Development team in the Scrum 2020 revision) consists of five to nine people and generally includes the typical functional roles required to complete the project. In software development, that usually means architects, testers, developers, and designers; but could also include security, performance, hardware and other experts.

- Product Backlog
    - A product backlog is a list of everything that needs to be achieved on a project, broken down into individual items. 
    - This is where the baseline requirements of every feature needed for the end product are prioritized by the product owner for the Scrum team.
    - The product backlog is usually made up of several different types of items:
      - User stories, which are high-level descriptions of a feature, told from the perspective of the end-user of the product.
      - Bugs are problems that arise that the product owner wants to be fixed.
      - Tasks, which are assigned to the scrum team to complete.

- Release Backlog
    - A release is most frequently associated with a major functionality delivered according to the product roadmap. The release backlog is the list of prioritized user stories from the product backlog that are currently included into the next set of scheduled releases. Depending upon the organization’s cadence for releasing functionality, a release may consist of two or more Scrum sprints.

- A Scrum event or “ceremony” is simply a regular meeting on an agile project, such as the sprint planning meeting, the daily stand-up, the sprint review, and the sprint retrospective. 
- Scrum events or Scrum ceremonies foster team collaboration and make sure that there’s a constant line of communication among the scrum team members through the product or software development life cycle.

    - Release planning
    - Sprint planning
    - Sprint review
    - Sprint retrospective
    - Daily scrum or stand up
    - Backlog grooming or refinement

- Daily Stand-Up
    - The daily standup is where the team members discuss their progress confirming their commitments to the sprint goals and risks impeding their progress. These should ideally be 15-minute meetings where everybody in the scrum team talks about the tasks they’ll be working on during the day and share any roadblocks or difficulties they’re facing. There’s no need to make this daily scrum meeting longer, as there are other meetings such as sprint reviews and sprint retrospectives to explore more complex topics.
