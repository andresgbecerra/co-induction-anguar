# Tell me about a time you failed at something

- In my previous job, I started working as a software developer. It was the first time I was part of a big project. I had two weeks to develop a few components of the application. I didn’t plan it well, and I missed the deadline. It delayed other team members who needed to use my part for their work. I failed my team and the customer. Since then, I always plan out various milestones in a schedule before I start coding. I’ve never missed a deadline since then.
- In my first job, I was assigned to make a series of changes to a customer’s live website. I had two hours to do them. I hadn’t tested the changes before, and they didn’t work. I undid everything because time was running out. I had to schedule the process all over again, and the customer was upset. Since then, I always use a test server to apply all changes and validate them before taking them to a live website.

# What did you like or dislike about your previous role?

- What I really dislike is that there is no room for growth in that company. It’s a small business, and as a developer I cannot really move up the career ladder. Surely, I learned a lot with them, and I also believe that I helped them too. I believe that I should have a better job at the moment, perhaps a role of a senior developer or tech lead. That’s why I applied for a job in your company, where I see more opportunities for career growth.

# In your current (last) position, what features do (did) you like the most? The least?

- The most: “I enjoyed having to use my initiative. I have implemented and improved a number of the systems including the order processing system.”
- The least: “There was a lack of growth opportunities in such a small company. One of the reasons I am so interested in your company is that it is a much larger organization with formal career planning structures already in place.”
