- **Sell Yourself**
In my previous position, I put in many late nights to ensure that our monthly client newsletter went out on time and that it met that the company's high-quality standards. Because of layoffs, we were understaffed and I volunteered to take on many additional tasks beyond my role.
I wrote stories, edited for other writers, oversaw layout, and served as the final proofreader to ensure no mistakes made it to press. The issue was a huge success and it resulted in a lot of positive feedback from clients and from senior management.
I have always been that person who is first in the office in the morning and last to leave in the evening. 
I even taught myself programming so that I could be more valuable to my team on our site redesign project. I'm not happy unless I know I'm giving my all.

- **greatest strengths as a developer:**
 
- Let’s see. I’m persistent— I am constant with the development of a project. I do not give up searching, learning, and changing what is necessary to get the requirements. I mean I take each goal as mine.

- and  I am adaptable— I have learned new frameworks for both environments web and mobile, to collaborate or contribute best practices in the applications and the layout.

- And finally, I think I'm Meticulous— I keep an eye on the details, I mean when I am writing lines of code any wrong character can break the software. I´m meticulous in that sense

- I consider myself impatient, that is, I require immediacy, I like to see the results a little earlier, I would like to advance faster, but then what I do is to set benchmarks in the tasks and work to achieve them, this way I feel I can have results in the short term.

- **preferred development environment:**
  - I would like to be part of multicultural development teams, share knowledge, and experiences, and I would like to have the opportunity to learn about new techniques, methods, and software architectures. 




# Experiences

  - I have worked with some Amazon workspace services, in a project that had the goal to control and monitor an industrial boiler through an augmented reality mobile application implemented in Unity with vuforia and a web application in angular that also allowed to check the status of the boiler components.
  - The industrial boiler has a simens logo 8 PLC that allows to connect with AWS IoT service to send all the analog signals from the sensors and valves of the boiler components.
  - This application also used AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a backend server with a MySQL database in AWS RDS.
