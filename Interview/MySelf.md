## Personal Interview

- **Tell me about yourself:**
  - I have spent the last five years building my skills as a Frontend developer in Angular for the Satena airline with In-house projects for personnel, Aircraft maintenance, and inventory management, then in Annar Technologies I was part of a Scrum team where I implemented several components for the analysis and presentation of data from medical equipment of laboratories that it takes clinical samples, integrating graphs, tables and reports with third-party libraries, I also had the opportunity to work on several projects such as Kite environment, which is a website that allows you to manage orders for the collection of used oil for recycling, which also uses Angular and node.js and Qualiapps which is a mobile application implemented in android for the analysis of particulate matter from cement plants in Colombia. I like to search and solve issue in the code and I try to be very accurate with the wireframe.

- **Tech Experience:** & **most interesting project:**
  - I have worked with some Amazon workspace services, in a project that had the goal to control and monitor an industrial boiler through an augmented reality mobile application implemented in Unity with vuforia and a web application in angular that also allowed to check the status of the boiler components.
  - The industrial boiler has a simens logo 8 PLC that allows to connect with AWS IoT service to send all the analog signals from the sensors and valves of the boiler components.
  - This application also used AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a backend server with a MySQL database in AWS RDS. 

- **Why are you a best Fit**
  - ????? 

- **greatest strengths as a developer:**
 
- Let’s see. I’m persistent— I am constant with the development of a project. I do not give up searching, learning, and changing what is necessary to get the requirements. I mean I take each goal as mine.

- and  I am adaptable— I have learned new frameworks for both environments web and mobile, to collaborate or contribute best practices in the applications and the layout.

- And finally, I think I'm Meticulous— I keep an eye on the details, I mean when I am writing lines of code any wrong character can break the software. I´m meticulous in that sense

- I consider myself impatient, that is, I require immediacy, I like to see the results a little earlier, I would like to advance faster, but then what I do is to set benchmarks in the tasks and work to achieve them, this way I feel I can have results in the short term.

- **preferred development environment:**
  - I would like to be part of multicultural development teams, share knowledge, and experiences, and I would like to have the opportunity to learn about new techniques, methods, and software architectures.
