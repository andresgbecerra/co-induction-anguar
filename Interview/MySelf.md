# Experiences
- **Tech Experience:** & **most interesting project:**
  - The last project before joining Unosquare, was related to a software for quality control of clinical samples implemented in clinical laboratories in Colombia, the main objective of the project was to manage the data of each clinical sample and facilitate the interpretation through the use of graphs, grids and different components.
  - Using Angular with redux to improve performance and share data across the application.
  - I have worked with some Amazon workspace services, in a project that had the goal to control and monitor an industrial boiler through an augmented reality mobile application implemented in Unity with vuforia and a web application in angular that also allowed to check the status of the boiler components.
  - The industrial boiler has a simens logo 8 PLC that allows to connect with AWS IoT service to send all the analog signals from the sensors and valves of the boiler components.
  - This application also used AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a backend server with a MySQL database in AWS RDS.
